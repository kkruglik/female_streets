# Research: in honour of which women streets are named in Russia

Research for the publication Glasnaya on gender naming of streets in Russia. 

> 5 streets are named in honour of women, 300 - in honour of men. This is the standard toponymic layout for an average Russian city. Sometimes there are slightly more women, sometimes there are slightly fewer, but the ratio reflects the state of affairs: women's names are perpetuated in names many times, ten times less often than men's.

> It would seem that modernity makes it possible to correct the gender imbalance in street naming - new neighbourhoods are being built, which means that new streets need to be named. However, the commissions responsible for this prefer neutral names like Abrikosova Street or Tenistaya Street. Experts believe that naming a street in honour of a woman may cause discussions, and the authorities are now trying to avoid any disputes.

> With the help of data research and expert interviews, Glasnaya tries to understand what is the reason for the gender imbalance in toponymy, why it is not being corrected today, and whether it will continue.
